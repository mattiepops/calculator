# Calculator Project
________

Wecome ***Kelian*** to my masterpiece! :bowtie:

Please find the **calculator project link** [here] (https://mattiepops.github.io/calculator/).

### Reason for this project:
________

We were asked to put our newly discovered JS skills to test, by creating a calculator and coding all the functionality of a standard calculator. 

We were asked to code all the tags and elements directly in JS.


### What did I learn from this experience:

I learned how much I don't know about JS, and that I am very thankful to indian guys on Youtube, and also to my colleagues at BeCode for helping me out when I needed help. 

Also I got a taste of how the logic behind JS works, and what my train of thought needs to be to translate my ideas into code. 

## Problems encountered:

I had so much trouble understanding what I need to do initially. I did not know where or how to begin, and I still don't fully understand how to structure and read JS code. A lot of functions and statements that I coded, I would not have in a million years known had to do at the beginning of this exercise, and I still don't think I can reproduce it fully by myself if I had to do it again.

One technical problem that I have not managed to resolve, is to get the brackets to function. After a lot of confusion trying to fix this problem, I left them as they were... :sob: :expressionless:

### Conclusion
_____

In the end, I powered through and managed to create a functional calculator!

Thank you for reading this readme and giving me feedback on the project :punch:
